1) Draw a tree for which the preorder and inorder traversals generate the same sequence.

A tree will have the same inorder and oreorder traversals if all the left sub tree is null.

                 \
                  7
                 /  \
              null    9


2) Design an algorithm (pseudocode or prose) to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree
