1) Draw a tree for which the preorder and inorder traversals generate the same sequence.

A tree will have the same inorder and oreorder traversals if all the left sub tree is null.

               4
                 \
                  7
                 /  \
              null    9


2) Design an algorithm (pseudocode or prose) to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.

array = tree.elements         |  return the elements of binary tree in a inorder traversal in an array
if array == array.sorted()    |  check if the array is sorted, must be sorted if it is BST
  return true                   
else
  return false

3) Design an algorithm (pseudocode or prose) to check if a binary tree is perfectly balanced (smallest height possible for the number of nodes)
